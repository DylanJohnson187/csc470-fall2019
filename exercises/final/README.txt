Final Project – Design Document
Gotta Get to Class
	The game I want to make is one where you are a player in the Don Meyers building which I hope to model in unity 3D and your objective is to avoid the enemies while collecting what you need for that day. Maybe the items you need for one level are a note book, a laptop, and a pencil and you need to find them with in the building without getting caught by one of the “enemies,” once you have them you can dip into the end location like a classroom or office. However, if you get caught an ending dialogue will be trigger and the screen will fade to black. The core mechanic of this game is going to be running around the map with a first-person perspective, the mouse lets you look around and you move by WASD. I would love to have cool controls like a slide or a wall jump, but there are going to be a part of the advanced mechanics discussed in a later section. I would love to have the visual style make Don Meyers look somewhat cartoonish, but I haven’t really decide on how to do it yet, the classrooms may be somewhat bland, but I really want to have obstacles you need to avoid like chairs and desks that you can hop over or slide under but the people chasing you will need to go around.  
In terms of audio, I want to have one song and one song only for the background music and that is Duel of the Fates by John Williams & The London Symphony Orchestra but honestly, I may need a couple more songs like this for different levels. I think I want to have 3 different levels each one will encompass a different difficulty. For instance, in level 1 you will have far few enemies and only need to collect 3 items where as for level 3 you will have a lot of faster enemies and need to collect 5 things. Each level will have some classical song from a “big name” movie I will try to make it as fitting as possible. In terms of interface I would like to have a store where you can spend the points you get unlocking new playable characters or abilities but seeing as I want this to be first person abilities will probably be cooler than player skins. I would like to have my menu design open with a main menu where you can select:
-	New Game
-	Continue Game/ Level Select
-	Store (where you would buy items & skins with in game currency)
-	Exit Game
For a story / theme I am debating one story being like your late for class and you need to get all of your things to be ready for it. So, you need to avoid conversations with other people in Don Meyers who are going to make you late for you class. Similarly, if you select the generic teacher player you are doing the same thing. Based on what character you select you will have a different introduction cutscene where the NPC will say a different dialogue to you based on whether you are a student or a professor. This is my current idea for a theme/ story for my game. 

Low – Level Target:
	- Basic model of Don Meyer’s building with class rooms and floor layout
	- player controls work but no special abilities like slide
	- player/enemies are basic primitive objects (cubes, cylinders etc)
	- No special abilities or mechanic
	- No functioning store
	- Only one level
Medium-Level Target:
-	All of low-level target
-	Has special mechanics like slide and wall jump
-	Multiple levels
-	Player/Enemies have human like models
-	NPC’s move logically and smoothly
-	Don Meyers more flushed out with included obstacles
High-Level Target:
-	All of medium-level target
-	Has even more special mechanics, like maybe invisibility/invulnerability for a time
-	Randomly generated levels (collectibles are randomly allocated, so are number of enemies and their local speed)
-	An even more flushed out Don Meyers includes white boards, wall décor, obstacles like tables, desks, and chairs, and possibly even doors. (In my opinion I think doors are going to be difficult to work so I want to avoid them).
Things I want to avoid:
-	Anything at all that makes this game seem like a shooter, I realized while typing this up this game could easily be misconstrued so I want it to be more like a parkour/running game through a building I am aptly familiar with. Not anything dark, so I really don’t want to add anything that could take a light-hearted game of getting to class into something terrifying. I feel like just keeping this in mind is important. I was think more like a chase based game like pac-man. 

Time Line:
	Next Class Nov 18th: I would like to have a basic model of Don Meyers
	November 21st: I would like to have a working character and NPCs
	November 25th: Item Collection and levels are designed
	November 28th: Special moves designed and implemented
	December 2nd: Store & menu implemented
	From here until submission: Flushing out visual details and adding audio -> I hope that all gameplay implementations are done by this time.
