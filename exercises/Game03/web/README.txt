I plan on attempting to make the game of chess for this assignment, there are two main parts of design I need to think about, object creation and game mechanics. First, I will discuss object creation. There are two main thing that need to be created the board, which itself will be a game object made out of 64 Cube (8x8), and prefab pieces to represent all the pieces in the game of chess (pawn, rook, knight, bishop, king, queen). I will probably attempt to find these game pieces in google poly, do the whole empty object thing and then make them into prefabs, but we will see I may just make extremely basic game objects. The object creation part is the simplistic part of this project. The more convoluted implementation. 
So far as implementation goes, the bells and whistles that I would like to implement come in two forms displays to UI and controlling click operation, sometimes they are one in the same. So, I want have a UI block similar to that in the in class demo, which will display the chosen piece, the current board state value, and a button to go to the selected position in the board. This board position will be select by a click on the board, but I want to hold movement of the piece until the button has been clicked. Then we have to deal with the collision of pieces which will denote that a piece has been capture I think this will be done by simple box colliders and tagging all pieces with their color light/dark, if a light piece hits a dark piece, destroy the dark piece and vice versa. Additionally, I want the board to show valid moves, when a piece is selected by highlighting the tiles it can move to with green pieces. 
Finally, I am first going to implement this as a two player game, but if I can do this within a reasonable time then I am going to implement a computer player affectionately dubbed Bottson.
